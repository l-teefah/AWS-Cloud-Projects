## **Section 1: Setting Up and Performing Database Operations**

1. **Create AWS Resources:**

   - Create a VPC, EC2 instance, and configure security groups.

   - Ensure the security group allows SSH (port 22) and MySQL (port 3306) traffic through inbund rules.

2. **Install MySQL on the EC2 Instance:**

   - Connect to the EC2 instance via SSH:

     ```bash
     ssh -i <your-key-pair.pem> ec2-user@<public-ip>
     ```
     
**Replace `<your-key-pair.pem>` with your key pair directory and `<public-ip>` with your EC2 instance's public IP**

   - Update the instance and install MySQL:

     ```bash
     sudo yum update -y
     sudo yum install -y mariadb-server
     ```

   - Start the MySQL service and enable it to start on boot:

     ```bash
     sudo systemctl start mariadb
     sudo systemctl enable mariadb
     ```

   - Secure the MySQL installation:

     ```bash
     sudo mysql_secure_installation
     ```

   - Log in to MySQL as the root user:

     ```bash
     mysql -u root -p
     ```

3. **Set Up the Database:**

   - Create a database named `globe`:

     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE globe;
     ```

   - Use the new database:

     ```sql
     USE globe;
     ```

4. **Insert, Update, and Delete Data:**

   - Create a `countries` table with the following schema:

     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE countries (
         country_id CHAR(3) PRIMARY KEY,
         name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
         continent VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
         population INT NOT NULL,
         area FLOAT NOT NULL
     );
     ```

   - Insert sample data:

     ```sql
     INSERT INTO countries (country_id, name, continent, population, area)
     VALUES ('NZL', 'New Zealand', 'Oceania', 5000000, 268021);
     INSERT INTO countries (country_id, name, continent, population, area)
     VALUES ('CAD', 'Canada', 'North America', 38000000, 9984670);
     ```

   - Update data:

     ```sql
     UPDATE countries SET population = 5100000 WHERE country_id = 'NZL';
     ```
     
**N.B:** When `WHERE` condition is not specified, this code affects all rows.

   - Delete data:

     ```sql
     DELETE FROM countries WHERE country_id = 'CAD';
     ```

   - Verify changes:

     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM countries;
     ```

5. **Import Data:**

   - Use this SQL file [`globe.sql`](globe.sql) to bulk import data and view:

     ```bash
     scp -i <your-key-pair.pem> <~/globe.sql> ec2-user@<public-ip> #upload sql file to EC2 instance
     mysql -u root -p globe <~/globe.sql> #import the data to the EC2 instance
     mysql -u root -p
     USE globe;
     SHOW TABLES;
     SELECT * FROM countries;
     ```
     
**Replace `<your-key-pair.pem>` with your key pair directory, ´<~/globe.sql>` with path to the globe sql file (e.g., ´~/Downloads/globe.sql`), and `<public-ip>` with your EC2 instance's public IP**

---

## **Section 2: Organizing Data**

1. **Group Data Using `GROUP BY`:**

   - Aggregate total population by continent:

     ```sql
     SELECT continent, SUM(population) AS total_population
     FROM countries
     GROUP BY continent;
     ```

2. **Calculate Running Totals Using `OVER`:**

   - Display a running total of populations by continent:

     ```sql
     SELECT continent, name, population,
            SUM(population) OVER (PARTITION BY continent ORDER BY population) AS running_total
     FROM countries;
     ```

3. **Rank Records Using `RANK`:**

   - Rank countries by population (highest to lowest) within each continent:

     ```sql
     SELECT continent, name, population,
            RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY continent ORDER BY population DESC) AS 'Rank'
     FROM countries;
     ```

---

## **Section 3: Selecting Data from a Database**

1. **Query All Data:**

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM countries;
   ```

2. **Filter Records Using `WHERE`:**

   - Retrieve countries with populations greater than 10 million:

     ```sql
     SELECT name, population FROM countries WHERE population > 10000000;
     ```

3. **Sort and Aggregate Data:**

   - Use `COUNT`, `ORDER BY`, and aliases:

     ```sql
     SELECT name, continent, population AS "Population Count"
     FROM countries
     ORDER BY population DESC;
     ```
     
**N.B:** The ORDER BY option orders data in ascending order so `DESC` needs to be specified.

---

## **Section 4: Working with Functions**

1. **Aggregate Functions:**

   - Calculate population statistics:

     ```sql
     SELECT SUM(population), AVG(population), MAX(population), MIN(population)
     FROM countries;
     ```

2. **String Manipulation Functions:**

   - Extract the first word from the continent name:

     ```sql
     SELECT continent, SUBSTRING_INDEX(continent, ' ', 1) AS first_word
     FROM countries;
     ```

3. **Filter Duplicates Using `DISTINCT`:**

   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT(continent) FROM countries WHERE population > 10000000;
   ```
4. **Find Regions with Names Fewer Than 10 Characters using LENGTH() and TRIM() to determine the length of trimmed strings:**

   ```sql
   SELECT continent
   FROM countries
   WHERE LENGTH(TRIM(continent)) < 10;
   ```

5. **Split Region Names into Two Columns:**

   ```sql
   SELECT 
       name,
       SUBSTRING_INDEX(continent, '/', 1) AS "Continent Name 1",
       SUBSTRING_INDEX(continent, '/', -1) AS "Continent Name 2"
   FROM countries
   WHERE Region = 'Oceania/Europe';
   ```

---

## **Section 5: Performing a Conditional Search**

1. **Filter Using `BETWEEN`:**

   - Retrieve countries with populations between 5 and 50 million, both codes below works the same:

     ```sql
     SELECT name, population FROM countries WHERE population BETWEEN 5000000 AND 50000000;
     ```
     
     ```sql
     SELECT name, population FROM countries WHERE population >= 5000000 AND population <= 50000000;
     ```
    
2. **Search for Patterns with `LIKE`:**

   - Find continents containing "America":

     ```sql
     SELECT name, continent AS "American Countries" FROM countries WHERE continent LIKE '%America%';
     ```

3. **Case-Sensitive Searches:**

   - Convert strings to lowercase using `LOWER` as SQL is not a case-sensitive language. You can use either SELECT or select when writing a query. However, databases that you query might be configured with a case-sensitive collation. If the database was case sensitive, you would not be able to query a column named Population by using `select population from countries`

     ```sql
     SELECT name, continent AS "American Countries" FROM countries WHERE LOWER(continent) LIKE '%america%';
     ```
     
4. **Specific Case Search:**

     ```sql
     SELECT 
         SUM(area) AS "Total Surface Area",
         SUM(population) AS "Total Population"
     FROM countries
     WHERE continent = 'Oceania';
     ```

## **Section 6: Database Table Operations**

1. **Alter a Table:**

   - Rename a column in the `countries` table:

     ```sql
     ALTER TABLE countries RENAME COLUMN area TO land_area;
     SHOW COLUMNS FROM countries;
     ```

2. **Drop Tables and Databases:**

   - Delete the `countries` table:

     ```sql
     DROP TABLE countries;
     ```

   - Delete the `globe` database:

     ```sql
     DROP DATABASE globe;
     ```
     
   - Exit MySQL:

     ```sql
     EXIT;
     ```

## **Notes and Troubleshooting Tips**

### **General Tips**

1. **Verify Connection Settings:**
   - Ensure your EC2 instance's security group allows inbound traffic on port 3306 for MySQL.
   - Confirm your SSH key and public IP address are correct.
   
2. **When using sudo, the system expects the password of the user account you are currently logged in as.**

3. **Validate SQL Syntax:**
   - Always check for syntax errors in SQL commands, especially when creating tables or inserting data.

4. **Check Permissions:**
   - Ensure the MySQL user has the necessary privileges to create databases, tables, and insert data.

5. **Backup Your Data:**
   - Before performing `DROP` or `DELETE` operations, back up your database to prevent accidental data loss.

### **Troubleshooting MySQL Issues**

1. **MySQL Service Not Starting:**
   - Run the following commands to check and restart MySQL:
   
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl status mariadb
     sudo systemctl restart mariadb
     ```

2. **Cannot Connect to MySQL:**
   - Ensure the MySQL service is running.
   - Verify that your MySQL user credentials (e.g., `root` and password) are correct.

3. **Import Errors:**
   - If importing an SQL file fails, verify that the file is in the correct format and contains valid SQL statements.

4. **Table Not Found Errors:**
   - Use the `USE` command to switch to the correct database:
   
     ```sql
     USE globe;
     ```

5. **Duplicate Key Errors:**
   - If inserting data results in a duplicate key error, verify that your primary key values are unique.
